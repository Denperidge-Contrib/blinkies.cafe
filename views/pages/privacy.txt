blinkies.cafe does not collect personally identifiable data.

to maintain & improve the quality of our blinkies, we log blinkie inputs & diagnostics:
  - blinkie text (& split)
  - blinkie style
  - blinkie scale
  - server processing time
  - ip address

we use these data to:
  - estimate & forecast server load
  - detect & fix bugs
  - prioritize character sets to add next
  - decide maximum text length to support

we use logged ip addresses to moderate the blinkie feed.

you can opt out of logging: if you add "/nolog " (without quotes) at the start of your custom text, your blinkie inputs will not be logged.
